# CY7C68013A 56 SSOP dev board

# Fix this:
* EEPROM connection's. I made a mistake for EERPOM address connection. Pin no.1 should be connected to EEPROM enable jumper.
* USB connector (if you gonna use usb C, don't do manual soldering. It doesn't really that strong, but if you gonna give it to PCBA I think it will gonna do it. Don't know why)
* Try black tactile button, it feel better
